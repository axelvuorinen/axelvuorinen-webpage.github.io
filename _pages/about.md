Welcome to my first webpage. I am a data scientist specialized in Biostatstics working on early phase clinical trial designs with pharmacokinetics(PK) and/or pharmacodynamics(PD) modelling. I am currently a PhD candidate employed by Inserm (French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) affiliated with the HeKA research team located in PariSant√© Campus. This page serves as an overview of my research contributions and academic achievements, which is rather empty at the moment as a junior researcher. I hope it provides valuable insights for anyone bumping into it on my work and professional journey.
