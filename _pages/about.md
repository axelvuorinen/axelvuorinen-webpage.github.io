Welcome to my first webpage. I am a data scientist specializing in biostatistics, with a focus on early-phase clinical trial designs involving pharmacokinetics (PK) and/or pharmacodynamics (PD) modeling. I am currently a PhD candidate employed by Inserm (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) and affiliated with the HeKA research team at PariSant√© Campus. This page provides an overview of my research contributions and academic achievements, though it is somewhat empty at the moment as I am still a junior researcher. I hope it offers valuable insights into my work and professional journey for any visitor.
